		All float coupons with start date greater or equal to the respective option expiry and all structured coupons with fixing date greater or equal to the respective option expiry
		are considered to be part of the exercise into right.
		We have the following curves:
		A The markov funcional models curve.
		B The instruments ibor index forwarding curve
		C The instruments swap index forwarding curve
		D The instruments swap index discounting curve
		Initially zero spread curves B-A_0, C-A_0, D-A_0 are built, where A_0 is the model curve at t=0. The spread curves are used as static corrections in the model solution, i.e.
		when evaluating ibor or swap coupons the relevant spreads from the curve are added to the model curve, the deflation is done using A + (D-A_0) and the final discounting is done on D.
		An example setup for a collaterized option on a swap exchanging EUR CMS10y vs. Euribor3m would be
		A = 6m Euribor forward curve
		B = 3m Euribor forward curve
		C = 6m Euribor forward curve
		D = Eonia curve

		// FIXME relevant floating coupons may have been fixed on or before today, this may cause problems below
		// FIXME ... how to register with the curves in iborIndex and swapIndex from which the spread curves are built? It is not possible in the constructor because we do not have the arguments there ...
