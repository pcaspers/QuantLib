Changes for QuantLib 1.7.1:
===========================

QuantLib 1.7.1 is a bug-fix release for version 1.7.

- an unneeded dependency on the Boost.Thread library had slipped into
  version 1.7. It is now removed (thanks to GitHub user MattPD).

- Trying to build a schedule with a 4-weeks tenor would fail. This is
  now fixed (thanks to GitHub user smallnamespace for the heads-up).

- A couple of errors in the list of past holidays for the Russian MOEX
  calendar was fixed, and the list of holidays for 2016 was added
  (thanks to Dmitri Nesteruk).

- Chinese holidays for 2016 were updated (thanks to Cheng Li).

- The correct curve is now used when calculating the at-the-money swap
  rate while building swaptions (thanks to Peter Caspers).
